# Text Classifier with Scikit-Learn

Classification of Textual Data using the following machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Ada Boost, and Random Forest

writeup.pdf: The main report of the project

## Jupyter Notebook Files:
1. NewsGroup Dataset.ipynb : Loading, Preprocessing, and Classification of 20 NewsGroup Dataset
2. IMDB_Reviews_Dataset_tfidf: Loading, Preprocessing (Unigram with no text normalization) and Classification of the IMDB Dataset
3. IMDB_Reviews_Dataset_tfidf_stemming: Loading, Preprocessing (Unigram with Stemming) and Classifcation of IMDB Dataset
4. IMDB_Reviews_Dataset_tfidf_lemming: Loading, Preprocessing (Unigram with Lemmatization) and Classifcation of IMDB Dataset
5. IMDB_Reviews_Dataset_tfidf_bigram: Loading, Preprocessing (Bigram with no text normalization) and Classifcation of IMDB Dataset
    
Each Jupyter Notebook file will download/load the appropriate dataset and run through the required text preprocessing and classifcation models. The IMDB Dataset jupyter notebook files are all similar except for the preprocessing technique used before classification. The IMDB_Reviews_Dataset_tfidf uses the same preprocessing techniques as the NewsGroup Dataset jupyter notebook file.
